The folks at https://templated.co provide a large number of HTML / CSS templates.

One of these themes is industrious which I wanted to make use of for a wordpress site, so this is their theme, converted to Wordpress.

The theme is a work in progress (although it has been placed on a live site at www.rftags.co.za). It uses ACF for some of the content like sliders, testimonials, etc.
